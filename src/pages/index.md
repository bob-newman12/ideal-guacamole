      I have made some amazing progress the past year. I went from not knowing
      what a stock was, to having a diverse portfolio that now provides me with
      a passive income bigger than my salary.

      I had been trading on my own for more than 3 years, but with not much
      success. Dr. Giovanna helped me refine my trading strategy and I have been
      in the green ever since.
