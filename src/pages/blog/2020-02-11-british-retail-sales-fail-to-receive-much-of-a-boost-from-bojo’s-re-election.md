However, [gold is trading in a bit of a range](https://www.fxleaders.com/news/2020/02/10/gold-trades-bullish-but-under-pressure-due-to-a-strong-us-dollar/) because of the strengthening in the US dollar, which shares a negative correlation with the precious metal. Meanwhile, rallies in gold prices remain contained as traders indulge in profit taking.

Markets are trading cautious as [China reopens some of its factories](https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/ct-nw-china-coronavirus-outbreak-20200210-lly57tsohrdsdlbqt4bw7viuri-story.html) and tries to bounce back to business as usual after remaining shut for an extended period of time in a bid to contain the spread of the virus. Gold is also trading cautious ahead of the Fed chairman’s testimony as markets look for clues about the US central bank’s outlook regarding the coronavirus outbreak and its economic impact.
